# Overview

This code venture really hit hard. My original goal was to learn how to make User Interfaces. 
However as the deadline came closer, it became apparent that I would need something that I could not get to work.
So I switched to reading exel sheets because my experience in that category was lacking.

The code calls up and read off an exel sheet of pokemon gym leaders, their type specialty, and their pokemon team.

This code is to allow you to search up a Gym Leaders team before you fight them, so that you can prepare for the battle before it starts. 
And this helps me personaly, because I often play games of pokemon on the road, so I am unable to look up these details online.

Here is a video of the code, and me pulling up different Gym Leaders teams.

# Development Environment

I coded this program on VSCode, and made the Gym team list in Exel.

I used python as the code, and I tried to use libraries, however they were more complicated than I thought.

# Useful Websites

These sites really helped me code and fix solutions while making this code.

# Future Work

I did not have the time to make this as fleshed out as I'd like. Here are some things that id do if I had more time
- Being able to find a certain pokemon or type on the list.
- Showing the Gym leaders before choosing the row so they can choose a specific leader.
- Add the 48 other gym leaders and their teams.
- add more detail to each team member, so you know what moves and abilities they have.
